# Restruct Silverstripe Admin Tweaks module

This module serves as a portable set of small Silverstripe functionality & styling tweaks by Restruct.

Currently it has been partially updated to SS4, most stuff is deactivated & will be reactivated when needed in projects.

Provides a global $ThemeDir replacement, eg:
`{$themeDirResourceURL('my-theme')}/videos/vid-{$RandomNumber}.mp4`
